* Development
* How to use
* Todo
** TODO handle multiple occuring IDs
* Rationale
- recount cellranger output bam files using different gtf files
- in cellranger this feature is missing and the alignment needs to be redone when recount is wanted
- should only need this folder, the bam file and a gtf file
  - obviously this gtf file needs to be compatible to the aligned genome (version)
